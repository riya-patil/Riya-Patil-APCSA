    <p>Time taken total: 3 hours</p>

<p>I was at question 34 when 1.5 hours was over</p>

<p>Overall Score: 52/66</p>

<p>I think I did pretty well on this test, however I had to guess on a lot of the questions. And I ended up guessing right on a lot of them but wrong on a lot more of them. I also think I got a little lazy near the end, since lots of my mistakes were found there.</p>

<p>Weak areas of mine are definitely 2D arrays, looking at long paragraphs of code, and time management. I think since last time I improved a little on loops, but I also still need to work on that area as well.</p>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>B. I chose this because I thought code segment 1 would work, but it actually doesn’t</td>
      <td>E. the real answer is that none of the code segments work for many different reasons. It actually increases each by 1.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>8</td>
      <td>B. This one was a silly mistake and I misread the question when I was answering, and thought that they would evaluate to the same</td>
      <td>D. The real answer is that they will evaluate to the same false value when they have different values and different when A and B are the same truth value</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>16</td>
      <td>A. I chose this answer because I thought that changing the col to be less than arr.length would be the answer and had to decide between 2</td>
      <td>C. The reason why it needed to include a : is because it is intended to assign a row of col but col is not a 2D array</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>21</td>
      <td>A. The private variable is actually allowed to be accessed because it uses a public constructor and method which can be called</td>
      <td>E. The real answer is this because the reset method returns a void type so it can’t have a value</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>34</td>
      <td>E. I chose this but it was wrong because it will create an out of bounds exception because it tries to access an array value at its end index</td>
      <td>D. This is the correct answer because the index k varies from 0 to arr.length -1, twice the value of arr[k] and outputs the same code sum</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>39</td>
      <td>B. This is wrong because the value 1984 is a multiple of 4, and not a multiple of 100, so the expression (val % 4) == 0 evaluates to true and the method returns true, as intended</td>
      <td>A. This is the right answer because this is an error because even though 1900 is a multiple of 100, it is not a multiple of 400, so the method should have returned false</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>42</td>
      <td>C. This is wrong because the reverse of nnoo is oonn and the strings are not equal</td>
      <td>E. This is correct because it’s a palindrome</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>48</td>
      <td>B. This is wrong because it outputs the wrong values, even though it’s the same amount</td>
      <td>E. This option is correct because it outputs the same values and can also be printed using a for loop with var k</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>49</td>
      <td>B. This is wrong because “W” is not printed because the expression a &gt; 0 evaluates to false. In option III, both a &lt; b and a &gt; 0 evaluate to true, so “W” is printed.</td>
      <td>C. This is correct because option 1 and 2 wont print out W due to the a&gt;0 so it won’t evaluate to true and W will not be printed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>60</td>
      <td>B. This is wrong because the first element of the returned array might not have the correct value.</td>
      <td>C. This option is correct because the last element of the array with the length of the result minus 1 might be the wrong value</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>61</td>
      <td>A. This is wrong because the TennisPlayer class implements the Student interface, a variable of type Student can reference an object of type TennisPlayer.</td>
      <td>D. I got this wrong because I didn’t know what interface meant, but the Athlete class doesn’t implement the student interface</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>62</td>
      <td>B. This is wrong because this set of values does not test the conditions when x is even and y is assigned the value 3.</td>
      <td>C. This is correct for the first conditional tests to see if x is even, if it is, y will be assigned the value 3.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>65</td>
      <td>C. This is wrong because it doesn’t have the correct value return for the classify method</td>
      <td>E. This value is correct because when it is plugged back into the method it returns the value of carClass</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>66</td>
      <td>D. The given code segment prints 13579. This code segment prints nothing because the condition in the for loop is initially false</td>
      <td>B. The correct way is that in this while loop, j is initially 1 and increases by 2 repeatedly while it is less than 10.</td>
    </tr>
